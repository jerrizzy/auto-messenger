# auto-messenger
This project is to automate messages from your device.

The goal for this project is to build an app or website that generates random messages to a user.

Ideally, the messages would be stored in database but for this project I have them stored in Lists. 

The user will receive random messages with the exception that the user gets to set the when they receive messages. Whether that's every hour. Every minute. Every second.

***Things to do**
- I am still working on figuring out how to create an option that randomizes the time the user receives a message.
- how long should a cycle last: A day? A week? Or after the program goes through every possible sequence of random messages it can create?




Please take a look. I welcome feedback. Ideas.
Thanks
